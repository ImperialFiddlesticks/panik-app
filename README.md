Parking Panic is a hackathon project designed to reduce the stress of parking in Stockholm.
The app combines map and location APIs with parking rule data to give users an immediate answer: 
Yes, No, or Yes, but… (with conditions such as time restrictions or fees).

It was built in a cross-disciplinary team with three .NET students responsible for the backend, 
while the frontend emphasized usability, accessibility, and fast decision-making.
